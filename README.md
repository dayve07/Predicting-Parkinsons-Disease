# **Predicting Parkinson's disease using Machine Learning**

# **üí°Context**

 * **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease** (PD) is a **degenerative neurological disorder** that irremediably decreases mental faculties and movement.

 * Due to the aging of the population, **the disease affects an ever-increasing proportion of the population**.

 * As with many diseases, **early detection is crucial for anticipating future treatments** and helping patients make necessary adjustments to their daily lives.
 
 * **Traditional detection through medical imaging is still expensive, invasive and time-consuming**. Detecting the disease using other techniques is a key issue in managing the disease.

<br>

# **üéØProject Goal**

* This project is aimed to **predict if an adult has the Parkinson Disease (PD) or not** by using AI and Machine Learning techniques. These techniques, that have emerged these last years offers an credible alternative to tradionnal detection.

* Based on **35 factual indicators** mainly regarding some **clinical measurements, medical history and cognitive assessments** of the patient, we will seek a way to predict the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease.
