# **Predicting Parkinson's disease using Machine Learning**

# **ðŸ’¡Context**

 * **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease** (PD) is a **degenerative neurological disorder** that irremediably decreases mental faculties and movement.

 * Due to the aging of the population, **the disease affects an ever-increasing proportion of the population**.
 
* **Traditional detection through medical imaging is still expensive, invasive and time-consuming**. Detecting the disease using other techniques is a key issue in managing the disease.

* As lots of other diseases, detecting the disease **as early as possible** to anticipate future treatments and necessary adjustments in their daily life.

**ðŸŽ¯Project Goal**

* This project is aimed to **predict if an adult has the Parkinson Disease (PD) or not**.

* Based on **35 different features** mainly regarding some **clinical measurements, medical history and cognitive assessments**, we'll look for the best Machine Learning model that will be able to predict the presence of Parkinsons diseases.
