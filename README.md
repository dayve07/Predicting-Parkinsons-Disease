# **Predicting Parkinson's disease using Machine Learning**

# **ðŸ’¡Context**

 * **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease** (PD) is a **degenerative neurological disorder** that irremediably decreases mental faculties and movement.

* **Detecting Parkinson's disease is not easy** because several factors come into play to conclude on the presence of the disease. Having one or more symptoms does not necessarily mean being affected by the disease.

* As lots of other diseases, detecting the disease **as early as possible** to anticipate future treatments and necessary adjustments in their daily life.
