# Predicting Parkinson's Disease : Datasheet


## Motivation

- <b>For what purpose was the dataset created?</b>

  This dataset was created for researchers and data scientists aiming to explore factors associated with Parkinson's Disease, develop predictive models, and conduct statistical analyses.

 - <b>Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?</b>
 
   This dataset was shared by Rabie El Kharou on kaggle.com. We don't have any specifications on who specifically created the initial dataset but the dataset has likely been created for educational purposes.

## Composition

- <b>What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)</b>

  The instances represent medical information of 2105 patients. The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a  diagnosis indicator, indicating if the patient has the Parkinson's Disease or not.

- <b>How many instances of each type are there?</b>

  There are 2105 instances.

- <b>Is there any missing data?</b>

  There's no missing data.

- <b>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?</b>

  The dataset contains highly confidential data as it comprises health information. Nevertheless, the Patient's ID and the Doctor in Charge have been previously anonymized.

## Collection process
- <b>How was the data acquired?</b>

  Unknown to the author of the datasheet.
  
- <b>If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy?</b>

  Patients are all over 50 years old but we are not able to conclude that this was part of a sampling strategy.
  
- <b>Over what time frame was the data collected?</b>

  Unknown to the author of the datasheet.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
- <b>Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.</b>

  No preprocessing of the data was done.

- <b>Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)?</b>

## Uses

- <b>What other tasks could the dataset be used for?</b> 
- <b>Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?</b> 
- <b>Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.</b>

## Distribution

- <b>How has the dataset already been distributed? </b>

  It is distributed by Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/parkinsons-disease-dataset-analysis.
  There might also be other places where the dataset is available.
  The author of the datasheet do now know when it first became publicly available, but the datacard on kaggle was last edited in 2024.  

- <b>Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)? </b>

  It is made available under the CC BY 4.0 license, allowing anyone to use the dataset in any form as long as proper citation is given to the author. 

## Maintenance
