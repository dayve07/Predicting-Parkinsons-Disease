# Predicting Parkinson's Disease : Datasheet


## Motivation

- <b>For what purpose was the dataset created?</b>

  This dataset was created for researchers and data scientists aiming to explore factors associated with Parkinson's Disease, develop predictive models, and conduct statistical analyses.

 - <b>Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?</b>
 
   This dataset was shared by Rabie El Kharou on kaggle.com. We don't have any specifications on who specifically created the dataset but the dataset has likely been created for educational purposes.

## Composition

- <b>What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)</b>

  The instances represent medical information of 2105 patients : the dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a  diagnosis indicator, indicating if the patient has the Parkinson's Disease or not.

- <b>How many instances of each type are there?</b>

  There are 2105 instances 

- <b>Is there any missing data?</b>

  There's no missing data.

- <b>Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?</b>

  The dataset contains highly confidential data as it comprises health information. Nevertheless, the Patient's ID and the Doctor in Charge have been previously anonymized.

## Collection process

- We don't have any specifications of how the data was acquired. The dataset was either consolidated within a medical institution, or was constructed statistically by an educational team.
- We don't have any information on a potential sampling strategy and over what time the data was collected or constructed.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- No preprocessing of the data was done. 
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?
